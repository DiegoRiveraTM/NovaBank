# NovaBank - A Fullstack Cloud-Based Digital Bank

## Project Overview 📄
NovaBank is a digital "Neobank" built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Docker containers, and AWS services (EC2, S3, CloudFront).  
It simulates real banking operations such as **deposits**, **withdrawals**, and **internal transfers** between users, using a secure **JWT-based authentication** system.

This project showcases modern fullstack development skills, cloud infrastructure deployment, and secure web application practices.
